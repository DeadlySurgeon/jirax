# Jirax

Simple VSCode extension I wanted to make to show as a PoC for creating other
VSCode extensions. This one allows for Jira Tickets to be interactable when in
golang code. Could this be used for other formats? Probably.

# Commands:

There are some commands that are available:

## Add Jira URL

This lets you add a Jira URL you may associate with.

## Add Jira Key

This lets you associate Jira Project Keys with your URL.

## Add Jira Token

This is how you let VSCode know your auth token so it can get the summary for
the ticket.

# A fair warning

I am not a Javascript nor Typescript developer. I know more than enough to get
this working at a bare minimum, however this repository will be critically
lacking in fundementals that would make it acceptable to modern Frontend
developers. I also made this as a proof of concept to work out my knowledge of
VSCode extensions so this comes with extremely limited support, if any.

Use with caution, you're on your own.

# Contributions

More than happy to accept contributions, however since this is more of a PoC
for myself to experiment with Extensions, there is a good chance I may not get
to issues or PRs. I do plan on expanding functionality but this will be more
inline with my actual requirements than nice to have features.

If all else, feel free to create a fork.
