# Jirax

Simple VSCode extension I wanted to make to show as a PoC for creating other
VSCode extensions. This one allows for Jira Tickets to be interactable when in
golang code. Could this be used for other formats? Probably.

# Commands:

Here are some commands that are available:

## Add Jira URL

This lets you add a Jira URL you may associate with.

## Add Jira Key

This lets you associate Jira Project Keys with your URL.

## Add Jira Token

This is how you let VSCode know your auth token so it can get the summary for
the ticket
